          </h3>

          <p className="text-violet-700 dark:text-white/80 mb-4 text-lg">
            EduCare started with a simple idea — to make quality education
            accessible to everyone, regardless of location or background. Our
            founders noticed that students and institutions often struggled with
            outdated and complex enrollment processes, leading to frustration
            and lost opportunities.

          <p className="text-violet-700 dark:text-white/80 mb-4 text-lg">
            Determined to make a difference, our team combined their expertise
            in education, technology, and design to create a platform that
            simplifies course enrollment, streamlines administration, and
            empowers learners to focus on what matters most — their education.
            Over the years, we have grown from a small idea into a trusted
            platform used by students, educators, and institutions. Every step
            of our journey has been driven by our commitment to innovation,
            dedication, and the desire to make learning a seamless, enjoyable
            experience for everyone. Today, EduCare continues to evolve,
            listening to feedback, embracing new technologies, and striving to
            make education more efficient, reliable, and accessible. Our story
            is one of passion, teamwork, and an unwavering belief that education
            can change lives.
